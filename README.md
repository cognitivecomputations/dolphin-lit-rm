Preamble for Evaluators: These rubrics are designed to assess a wide range of writing styles. When scoring, consider the specific form, genre, intended audience, and purpose of the piece. "Exceptional" execution in poetry will manifest differently than in a technical report, but the underlying principles of clarity, impact, and skillful construction apply across all forms.
I. Structural Design & Development
(Evaluates the overall organization, logical progression, and effective shaping of the content.)
A. Structural Coherence & Progression:
5 (Exceptional): The structure is masterfully crafted, exhibiting flawless logical/thematic/narrative progression. All parts are intrinsically linked, contributing to a powerful and unified whole, perfectly suited to the work's purpose and form.
4 (Accomplished): The structure is highly effective, with clear and logical/thematic/narrative progression. Most parts are well-integrated, contributing to a cohesive work.
3 (Competent): The structure is generally clear and supports the content, though some areas might lack optimal flow or integration. The progression is mostly logical/thematic/narrative.
2 (Developing): Structural weaknesses are apparent; progression may be confusing, disjointed, or underdeveloped. Connections between parts are often unclear.
1 (Deficient): Lacks a discernible or effective structure; content is chaotic, randomly organized, or fails to develop coherently.
B. Pacing & Rhythmic Management:
5 (Exceptional): Pacing is expertly controlled, creating an ideal rhythm (of information, events, imagery, argument, or emotion) that maximizes engagement and impact appropriate to the form.
4 (Accomplished): Pacing is highly effective, varying appropriately to maintain interest and effectively deliver content/experience.
3 (Competent): Pacing is generally adequate, though some sections may feel disproportionately rushed, slow, or monotonous for the intended effect.
2 (Developing): Pacing is often uneven or ill-suited to the content/form, hindering engagement or clarity.
1 (Deficient): Pacing is detrimental, making the work feel stagnant, overwhelming, or difficult to follow.

5 (Exceptional): A clear and compelling central idea, purpose, narrative core, or thematic tension is established and masterfully developed throughout, providing powerful focus.
4 (Accomplished): A well-defined central idea/purpose/tension is maintained and effectively explored.
